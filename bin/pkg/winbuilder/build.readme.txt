OpenSVC Windows Build survival guide
------------------------------------

Goal :
----
=> Deliver a single .exe installer with everything inside
=> Executable have to be upgradable

HowTo :
-----
=> install wix tools ( http://wixtoolset.org/ - known to work with 3.8 )
=> install nsis ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ - known to work with 3.0a2 )
=> install Visual C++ 2010 x86 redist files, needed by nmake.exe ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555 )
=> check that kits/vcredist content is OK (expected content is Visual C++ 2008 x86 redist files, not the same file as previous point)
=> check that kits/winpython content is OK (expected content is a folder named "python" with a ready to use python distrib, cleaned winpython for example)
=> launch a cmd.exe /V:ON to enable "delayed environment variable expansion"
=> check osvcenv.cmd is setting environment variables OSVCMAKEVERSION and OSVCMAKERELEASE
=> edit Makefile and verify/fix paths, validate with nmake.exe /N ( no execution, only macro interpretation )
=> give a try with nmake.exe, you should end up with a ready to use installer

Install :
-------
=> Graphical : Copy .exe to target host & double clic on the installer
=> Silent : Open a windows shell & launch installer with "/S" flag (uppercase)

Tunable Files :
-------------
=> osvcvar.cmd
=> Makefile
=> wxs/ExcludeList.txt : used to avoid copying temp/log/unwanted files in the final archive
=> wxs/opensvc.transform.xsl : used to modify xml stream produced by harvesting command heat.exe
=> wxs/OpenSVCproduct.wxs : Wix config file for OpenSVC msi package
=> nsis/opensvc.nsi : NSIS config file for EXE Bundle file (VC++ redist & Opensvc)

# Template etc/node.conf
#
#   This configuration file describes node-wide parameters.
#
#   This file can be left empty except for node.host_mode. The sync
#   schedule is autogenerated, based on the schedules described in the
#   sync#* resources defined in the service configurations. So no
#   sync schedule should be explicitely defined here.
#
#   The internal schedule default for  push actions is:
#     push actions          00:00-06:00@361 mon-sun
#     sync actions          04:00-06:00@121 mon-sun
#     compliance actions    02:00-06:00@241 sun
#     inventory actions     none

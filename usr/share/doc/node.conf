#   This configuration file describes node-wide parameters.

#   The interval-days-period tuple is used to tune the schedule of
#   jobs run by the 'opensvc' cron-job.

#   section is autogenerated, based on the schedules described in the
#   sync#* resources defined in the service configurations.

#     days:     all
#     period:   4am to 6am
#     interval: 1 day
#
#   The internal schedule defaults for 'compliance check' action are:
#     days:     sunday
#     period:   5am to 6am
#     interval: 1 week
